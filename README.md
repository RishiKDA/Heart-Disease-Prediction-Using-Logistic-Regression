# Heart Disease Prediction (Logistic Regression)

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on several health-related inputs.  
The notebook includes data loading, basic visualizations, model training, testing, and a simple manual input system to check risk for new cases.

## Files
- `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` — main notebook with all steps.
- `Heart_disease_cleveland_new.csv` — dataset used for training.

## What the notebook does
- Loads the dataset directly from GitHub.
- Converts columns into simple, easy-to-understand terms.
- Trains a logistic regression model on the cleaned numeric data.
- Shows model accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
- Includes a function where you can manually enter a person’s details and get a risk prediction.

## Notes
- This is just a basic machine learning project for learning/practice.
- The predictions are not meant for real medical use.
